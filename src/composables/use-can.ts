/**
 * Capability checks for the current member.
 *
 * Every capability is a ComputedRef so templates and computeds downstream
 * re-evaluate automatically when member/plan/deck-count state changes.
 *
 * Name capabilities by the feature, not by the role that currently has access.
 *
 *   Bad:  `can.administrate`  — implies "because they're an admin"
 *   Good: `can.manageUsers`   — implies "because they need to manage users"
 *
 * When a policy changes (e.g. paid users should now export analytics), edit
 * the single line in this file — every call site picks up the new behavior
 * automatically.
 *
 * @example
 * const can = useCan()
 * if (!can.createDeck.value) { ... }
